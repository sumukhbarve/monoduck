# examples-multi

While each Monoduck subpackage can have it's own examples-* directory, this directory is dedicated to housing examples that make use of _multiple_ subpackages.

Multi-subpackage examples not only illustrate how  multiple subpackages can be used together, but also _indirectly_ allow multiple subpackages to be tested together.

After `cd`-ing into an specific example, run `ls .cmd*` to see a list of supported command scripts. To run a command script, run `source .cmd.that.script.sh`.
