# Lookduck

### What is it?  
Lookduck is a minimal, TypeScript-first, React state manager; inspired by [Knockout's](https://knockoutjs.com/) observable pattern.

### How's it different?

It's intentionally simple, yet composable. It requires no boilerplate, and has under 50 lines of readable code.
