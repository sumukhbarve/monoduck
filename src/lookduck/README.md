# Lookduck

### What is it?  
- TypeScript-first, React state manager.
- Inspired by [Knockout's](https://knockoutjs.com/) observable pattern.

### How's it different?
- No boilerplate needed, not even a wrapping `<Provider>` component.
- **Automatic dependency management** for computed values (i.e. derived state).
- Intentionally simple, highly composable, and strictly typed.
